  <h2>Inside of Emptiness</h2>
  
  <p class="content paragraph">Inside of Emptiness is the sixth studio album by John Frusciante, released on October 26, 2004 on Record Collection, and is the fourth in a series of six releases, issued from June 2004 to February 2005. The album features contributions from Josh Klinghoffer and Omar Rodríguez-López. Frusciante <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604184714/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2005-press/01-jane">notes</a>, "It's really powerful, but in a gentle way. There's a soothing quality. It has hard things on it, and even the soft things have a heaviness to them. The song "Scratches" is emotionally heavy to me, even though it's not distorted guitars and bashing drums. There's another song about a couple's baby dying. There's a lot of spontaneity and recklessness and not giving a fuck." The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album.</p>

  <p id="whatISaw1">There's one room<br>
There's one light<br>
There's one night<br>
In the fire<br>
In the pain<br>
In the wire<br>
This from me<br>
This one lie<br>
That seems right<br>
Time can't climb<br>
It can't be<br>
It can't see<br>
I seem to be right, I fall down tonight<br>
I go to hell to be what I sell<br>
Failing again is such a welcome end<br>
Can the end of today be more than tonight<br>
Echoes of these far reaching sights<br>
And the pain of knowing you, should have tried<br>
Give me your hands, give me your hands<br>
Give me your hands<br>
And we'll never die<br>
We'll never die<br>
This love song<br>
It sits wrong<br>
It means jack<br>
The time's right<br>
To be wrong<br>
All night long<br>
I feel good<br>
I feel so far away<br>
This is mine<br>
It could be anyday<br>
I saw what I saw, I call up a man<br>
Distance is what gets me right in<br>
I have a hand in everyone losing their place<br>
Oh, never must stop, it's stealing my heart<br>
Moment's to squeeze begging on its knees<br>
I know I'll never be right beyond tonight<br>
So give me your hands<br>
Give me your hands<br>
And we'll never die<br>
We'll never die<br>
Give me your hands, give me your hands<br>
Give me your hands<br>
And we'll never die<br>
We'll never die, oh</p>
